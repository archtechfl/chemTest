		0: "Materials that will not burn under typical fire conditions, including intrinsically noncombustible materials such as concrete, stone and sand (Materials that will not burn in air when exposed to a temperature of 820 °C (1,500 °F) for a period of 5 minutes)",
		1: "Materials that require considerable preheating, under all ambient temperature conditions, before ignition and combustion can occur. Includes some finely divided suspended solids that do not require heating before ignition can occur. Flash point at or above 93.3 °C (200 °F).",
		2: "Must be moderately heated or exposed to relatively high ambient temperature before ignition can occur and multiple finely divided suspended solids that do not require heating before ignition can occur. Flash point between 37.8 and 93.3 °C (100 and 200 °F).",
		3: "Liquids and solids (including finely divided suspended solids) that can be ignited under almost all ambient temperature conditions. Liquids having a flash point below 22.8 °C (73 °F) and having a boiling point at or above 37.8 °C (100 °F) or having a flash point between 22.8 and 37.8 °C (73 and 100 °F).",
		4: "Will rapidly or completely vaporize at normal atmospheric pressure and temperature, or is readily dispersed in air and will burn readily (e.g. acetylene, propane, liquid hydrogen). Includes pyrophoric substances. Flash point below room temperature at 22.8 °C (73 °F)."
